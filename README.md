# DataStrucutres1
These folders contain code written for projects assigned in my Data Structures class. 
Here is a short description of each assignment 

Assignment 2: 
Uses a basic technique in Artificial Intelligence to automatically generate text. Reads in a piece of text 
and then uses that text as a basis to generate new text. The method for generating new text uses simple probability.

Assignment 4:
A compression algorithm for images which represent a block of pixels with the same color by simply
recording the first place where we encounter the new color and only recording information when we see a
new color.

Assignment 5: 
A postfix calculator program

Assignment 7:  
A program for Martin Gardner's Hex-A-Pawn game. User can either play against another user, against a CPU 
which makes random moves, or a CPU which implements artificial intelligence to choose smarter moves as 
it plays more games. 

Assignment 9: 
A program which efficiently handles queries for US population in a certain area. Can calculate the population using three
different algorithms

Assignment 10: 
A simulation of artificial life, where termites roam and pick up/place woodchips. Involves parallel programming to prevent 
race conditions. 

Assignment 11: 
A program which scrubs geographic data creates a directed graph to represent a map of the Irvine area. 
Using Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm, this program provides the user with directions (optimized by both time and distance of the trip) to 
and from specified locations.
